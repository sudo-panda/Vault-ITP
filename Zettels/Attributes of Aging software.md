### Attributes of Aging software 
- Functional obsolescence
	- Apps may become functionally obsolete if a business changes dramatically or a company discontinues a business or service
	- Challenging are cases where an application is functionally obsolete in parts, leaving a large code base with much unused functionality, which cannot be retired as some other functionality is still needed.
- Technical debt
	- Nor bad practice but result of many sensible decisions
	- The more technical debt an app has the more likely it will accumulate more
	- Business-critical systems: avoid risk - avoid major code changes - add tech debt
- Architectural obsolescence
	- Evolution in business and tech makes chosen arch obsolete
- Technical obsolescence
	- New apps are generally developed using tech then considered mature
	- My the time the app is mature the underlying tech is already in decline
	- Apps tend to have longer lifecycles than many techs
