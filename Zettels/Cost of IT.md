### Fixed Cost for Appl Skills
- Need 3-5 FTE per application or technology 
- A single staff member can cover multiple applications or technology within limits
- To keep knowledge accessible, each staff member needs to regularly use it
### Split of IT costs
- $22\%$: Solution Delivery
- $18\%$: Maintenance & Enhancement
- $60\%$: Operations
Operations is the largest cost block 
Typically only half of software development capacity can be used for solution delivery

| Total Cost        | 2.7             | 7.2        | 2.7   |
Effective costs (Final cost) are underestimated by a factor of <mark style="background: #FF5582DD;">2.7</mark>
