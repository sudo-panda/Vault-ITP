### Purpose
- Allow stakeholders to get an overview of applications/systems
- Provides for consistent ways of "doing things" across an app landscape
- Allows for a systematic evo of design decisions across an app landscape
- Increases agility by having one way of doing something and leveraging skills, exp, design artifacts, and components
- Increases agility by leaving freedom for different solutions in different components

### Pitfalls
- If there is no documented arch.,
	- Design work will be re-done in many projects
	- Inconsistent ways of doing things will lead to inconsistent data, functionality, or reliability and security problems
- If there is too much arch documentation, it will be ignored
- If the documented arch does not reflect the actual implemented systems, it is confusing, and will be ignored
- If the documented arch is not realistically implementable, it will be ignored
- If a guideline/standard does not serve an understandable need, it becomes a nuisance and will be ignored

### Good practice
- Do arch design and standardization only for a few aspects, which serve a business need, but do them very well
- Decide based on business needs which aspects need to be standardized, and at which level
- Adopt a federated arch organization and governance
