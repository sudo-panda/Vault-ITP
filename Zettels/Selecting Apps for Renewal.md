## Selecting Apps for Renewal
### Analyze the legacy situation
Understand for each attribute
- Does the application have it
- How big is it
- How large are risks if unresolved
- How much business value could be unlocked if resolved
### Select an app and approach w/ a positive business case or large risk avoidance
- Identify legacy applications that include large business risks
- Identify legacy applications where resolving issues unlocks large business value
- Focus on most attractive renewal opportunities, and put all others into either "do not touch" or "refactor" mode
- Select an approach that addresses the actual issues and unlocks business value or risk avoidance
### Examples
- Application running on obsolete technical platform, with little other legacy issues: REPLATFORM
- Application with strong business functionality, but architectural issues and technical debt preventing it to be extended further, such as for
	- merging acquired business into the application
	- leveraging the application in other geographies
	- implementing new business offerings
	LARGE REFACTORING INITIATIVE (focus: business needs)
- Application with outdated functionality, which is non-differentiating: REPLACE w/ PACKAGE
