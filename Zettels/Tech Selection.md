## Considerations in IT for Tech Selection
### New developments in IT
- Huge set of different technologies vendors products in just one field
- Fast triage what to look into
### Capabilities of a Technology
- **One technology solution covering all/most requirements**
	⊕ 
	- Only one technology and one supplier
	⊖
	- More complex technology
	- Less fit with individual set of requirements
	- Stronger dependence on supplier
- **Sets of requirements from different business stakeholders**
- Different, specific technology solutions for each set of requirements
	⊕
	- Close fit with each individual set of requirements possible
	- Each technology solution likely simpler and more flexible
	- Less dependence on single supplier
	⊖
	- Multiple technologies and multiple suppliers
	- New internal decision for each project which technology solution
### Stability and Maturity
### Architectural fit
### Availability of skills
### Attractiveness/"sexiness" of technology
