## Considerations in IT for Tech Selection
## New developments in IT
- Huge set of different technologies vendors products in just one field
- Fast triage what to look into
## [[Capabilities of a Technology]]

## Stability and Maturity

| Product  | Offered functionality inexistent or working differently as planned<br>           | Product cannot be used as-is, requiring<br>    - Waiting for new releases<br>	- Build of functionality outside product<br>	- Business process adaption to fit product<br> |

### Proxies to Assess
- Brand Recognition
- Market leadership / market share
- IT Research company assessments
- Proof of Concept projects
- References

### Ubiquitous self-reinforcing cycle of adoption
- More users $\mapsto$ More references $\mapsto$ Higher market share, press coverage, brand recognition $\mapsto$ More users..
- **Secondary Self - Reinforcing cycle of product growth:**
  More users $\mapsto$ More requirements $\mapsto$ More functionalities $\mapsto$ Growth into further areas of use $\mapsto$ More users
- **Secondary Self - Reinforcing cycle of Platform growth:**
  More users $\mapsto$ Attractive as a platform to develop for . . . $\mapsto$ . . . many available skilled resources,  many available products $\mapsto$ More users
## Architectural fit

## Availability of skills
## Attractiveness/"sexiness" of technology
