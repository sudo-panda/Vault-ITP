Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented. Two laws:
1. Everything is a trade-off
2. "Why is more important than how"

Different Archs for different design aspects
- Application Arch
- Infrastructure Arch
- Software Layer Arch
- Data Arch . . .

## [[Purpose, Pitfalls, Good Practice]]

## Modularization
- The degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined, often with the benefit of flexibility and variety in use.
- In software design, typical modularization objectives are:
	- Enable independent design, implementation, and test of individual modules by different teams
	- Increase flexibility/agility by new requirements only impacting one or few modules
