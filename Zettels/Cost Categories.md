- Main cost drivers are internal and external staff, followed by licenses, and services
- The services categories can be expected to grow with the adoption of more SaaS/PaaS
- Licenses categories can be expected to grow with companies adopting more standard software, except when they use it in a SaaS-model

What happens if Cloud?
- Most cost categories with change with energy, hardware and infrastructure software license shrinking, and cloud services growing
- No categories completely disappears as companies will always have some local infrastructure
- Often the expectation is that less staff is required, may not be so as cloud maintainence may require staff
