| **IT Operations**               | Energy, Hardware, Infrastructure software licenses, telecom | - Resource consumption (CPU, memory, storage, network, database) | Expected sublinear with business volume for most business applications |
|                                 | Software Deployment                                         | - Defect Density<br>- Frequency of updates                       | Expected small fixed                                                   |

| **Maintenance & Enchancements** | Software Development                                        | - Application complexity                                         | 10-15% of original development cost annually                           |

#### Corollary for IT Investments
- The cost structure in IT is largely a reflection of past IT investment decisions, and very hard to change as long as you continue using respective applications.
- If you decide to implement an application today, it is a given that you will have operations and maintenance costs when you use the application in the future, which are largely fixed
- A solid rule-of-thumb for estimating expected maintenance cost is <mark style="background: #FADF63EE;">10-15%</mark> of original investment costs annually
