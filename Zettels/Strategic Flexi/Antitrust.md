## Antitrust
### Essential Facilities Doctrine
If you own a "facility essential to other competitors" you are required to provide reasonable use of that facility. The basic element of a legal claim are:
1. control of the essential facility by a monopolist
2. a competitor's inability to practically or reasonable duplicate the essential facility
3. the denial of the use of the facility to a competitor
4. the feasibility of providing the facility to competitors

> You are allowed to build a monopoly and maintain it, but you are not allowed to use it hindering competition in connected markets
