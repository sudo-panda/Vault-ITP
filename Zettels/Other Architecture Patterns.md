- Service Mesh
	- Infrastructure layer handling service-to-service comms and corresponding config
	- Part of cloud native arch
- Backend for frontend
	- Services providing Frontend-specific APIs, e.g. lil data for mobile device use or rich analytics data for feature-rich front-ends
	- Enables more efficient/ faster front ends
- Micro-frontends
	- Applying microservices concepts to front-ends
	- More independent development
- Serverless & Function as a Service
	- Enabling to run a time-restricted function without explicitly allocating a server, reacting to events
	- Saving on cloud infrastructure for rarely running functions
- Event sourcing
	- Storing all data as events, never deleting data and providing "projections" of the actual state of data
- Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)
	- Add-on to Event Sourcing, letting different components handle change/commands and queries providing projections
- Distributed ledger Technology/Blockchain
	- Using event-sourcing, implementing automatic replication and distributed consensus with untrusted parties
- Hexagonal/Ports & Adapter Arch
	- Separating core business logic from external concerns
	- Makes external concerns independent from core business logic
- Data Mesh
	- Breaking down data into data products managed by different teams with federated governance
	- Concept of domain-driven design/microservices applied to data
- Space-based Arch
	- Aims for high scalability through in-memory data grids and distributed processing
	- Impact:?
- Reactive/stream processing
	- Real-time processing of events or data streams
	- Real-time
