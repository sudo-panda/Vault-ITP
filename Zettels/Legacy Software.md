## Legacy Software
- Functionally fit-for-purpose
- Has a some combination of:
	- Tech debt
	- Technical obsolescence
	- Architectural obsolescence
	- Partial functional obsolescence

### Approaches to address legacy software 
- Do not touch
- Rewrite
	- Typically large scale programs with a high rate of failure
	- Experienced challenges
		- **Long duration** with nothing to show (big bang) or lil true benefit until the end erode momentum on business and subsequently IT side (step-wise)
		- **High complexity**
		- Lack of detailed business logic understanding
		- Need to invest into two systems
		- Project abortions often leave company in a worse situation than before the project
- Replace with package
	- projects have different sizes, depending on the amount of functionality covered
	- project success rate is high, even though there are a number of high-profile failures, in particular in cases where the supplier could not deliver functionality the customer considered important
	- satisfaction after migration varies a lot, with reported weaknesses including
		- functionalities do not support the business as well as the former solution
		- high efforts for surrounding systems which close gaps of the package or integrate with it
		- ability to obtain new functionalities low
		- package suffering from legacy issues too
- Replatform
	- projects are narrowly defined to address technical obsolence
	- moving the application onto a different tech platform leaving functionality, architecture and tech debt as is
	- static code translators are used if possible, ehich have a bad reputation of generating hard to maintain code

- Refactor
	- Gradually addressing legacy issues in an app, leaving app in place, and changing or rewriting parts over time
	- With it being an ongoing activity with small steps it
		- <mark style="background: #88FF88DD;">has low risk</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #88FF88DD;">no radical changes in app</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">cannot be evaluated well (not binary success or failure)</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #88FF88DD;">fits well into maintenance activities for the app</mark>
- Software mimicry
	- Use AI and large number of observations
