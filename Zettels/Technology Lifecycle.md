### Emulation

### Security considerations

### Key Takeaways
- Every technology is subject to a lifecycle from inception to decline and obsolescence
- In IT, total duration ranges from 60+ years (IBM Mainframe) to 40+ years for highly successful technologies to less than 20 years for less successful ones
- Emulation can add a significant number of years to the use of an obsolete technology
- Obsolescence is generally a weak reason to quickly replace systems relying on it, but often used as an argument
- Making good technology decisions in light of lifecycle considerations is very challenging

### Attributes of Aging software 
- Functional obsolescence
	- Apps may become functionally obsolete if a business changes dramatically or a company discontinues a business or service
	- Challenging are cases where an application is functionally obsolete in parts, leaving a large code base with much unused functionality, which cannot be retured 
- Technical debt
- Architectural obsolescence
	- Evolution in business and tech makes chosen arch obsolete
- Technical obsolescence
	- New apps are generally developed using tech then considered mature
	- My the time the app is mature the underlying tech is already in decline
	- Apps tend to have longer lifecycles than many techs
