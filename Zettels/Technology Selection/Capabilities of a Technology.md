- **One technology solution covering all/most requirements**
	⊕ 
	- Only one technology and one supplier
	⊖
	- More complex technology
	- Less fit with individual set of requirements
	- Stronger dependence on supplier
- **Sets of requirements from different business stakeholders**
- **Different, specific technology solutions for each set of requirements**
	⊕
	- Close fit with each individual set of requirements possible
	- Each technology solution likely simpler and more flexible
	- Less dependence on single supplier
	⊖
	- Multiple technologies and multiple suppliers
	- New internal decision for each project which technology solution to use
- **Very complex trade-offs**
	- High uncertainty about evolution of requirements and technology solutions
	- Technology solutions often impact other technology areas

| ⊕ Less solutions and suppliers to manage<br>⊕ Simpler decision making internally and enforcement once established | ⊕ Solution more tailored to problem at hand<br>⊕ Less to learn<br>⊕ Less to coordinate with others |
| ⊖ More difficult and controversial to choose initially<br>⊖ Stronger dependence on single supplier                | ⊖ Only relevant in this field, little use if I move elsewhere                                      |
