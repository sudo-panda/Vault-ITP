### Proxies to Assess
- Brand Recognition
- Market leadership / market share
- IT Research company assessments
- Proof of Concept projects
- References

### Ubiquitous self-reinforcing cycle of adoption
- More users $\mapsto$ More references $\mapsto$ Higher market share, press coverage, brand recognition $\mapsto$ More users..
- **Secondary Self - Reinforcing cycle of product growth:**
  More users $\mapsto$ More requirements $\mapsto$ More functionalities $\mapsto$ Growth into further areas of use $\mapsto$ More users
- **Secondary Self - Reinforcing cycle of Platform growth:**
  More users $\mapsto$ Attractive as a platform to develop for . . . $\mapsto$ . . . many available skilled resources,  many available products $\mapsto$ More users
-  IT Research Companies as amplifiers for self-reinforcing cycles: Example Gartner, inc.
	- CIO surveys
	- IT Trends 202x
	- Technology briefs
	- Gartner Magic Quadrant

### Corollaries
- In every tech field there is a strong drive towards an oligopoly
- Dominating products tend to be technically outdated
- Being successful with a new IT product:
	- **Minimal viable Product**
		- Great use case
		- Strong technical capabilities
		- Room for experimentation
		- Quick feedback cycle with users
	- **First references / lighthouse projects**
		- Access to early adopters
	- **Rapid scale-up**
		- Large amount of capital
		- Ability to very quickly scale organization
	- **Growth into neighboring fields**

### Tricking the system
- Leveraging the company brand for overselling
- Using the brand of a successful product to sell another product

### Future trouble
- Suppliers changing their business model from software provider to service providers
- Customers being sued by 3rd party patent holders
	- Nokia being
