#### Best Practices
- Aim to quantify all aspects of benefits, costs, and risks
- Ensure all benefits, costs, and risks are included
- Put the different benefits and costs on a timeline, distinguishing when they will be incurred
- If there are large risks or uncertainties, use ranges for the figures and perform a sensitivity analysis with best-case, worst-case and expected scenarios

#### Success Rate of IT Projects
| Failed $53\%$ | Partially Successful $31\%$ | Successful $16\%$ |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
- Cost overrun on average $89\%$
- Time overrun on average $122\%$

##### Reasons for project failure
| Reason                          |  % age |
| ------------------------------- | -----: |
| Incomplete requirements         | $13\%$ |
| Insufficient user involvement   | $12\%$ |
| Inadequate resources            | $11\%$ |
| Unrealistic user expectations   | $10\%$ |
| Insufficient management support |  $9\%$ |
| Requirement changes             |  $9\%$ |
| Insufficient planning           |  $8\%$ |
Most reasons are at the interface of business and IT

### Components of a Business Case
- **Benefit**
	- All benefits obtained when using the product resulting from the project or investment
	- Quantified and separated for every year in which it is planned to be used
	- Note that "cost reductions" are benefits
- **Cost**
	- **Project costs in business**: All costs incurred in the business for the project, e.g., project management, business analysis, user acceptance testing, training
	- **Project costs in IT**: All costs incurred to realize the project in IT
	- **Ongoing costs in business**: Some projects lead to additional business costs once in use, e.g., for staff using the product, or for advertising the new Services enabled by the project. Since all benefits are counted, also all cost need to be counted
	- **Ongoing costs in IT**: Costs to maintain and to operate the resulting application, since 
- **Risks**
	- **Project risks**: Risks that will endanger the project, incl. assessment of how it will impact benefits and costs described above
	- **Operational risks**: Specific additional risk in the business
