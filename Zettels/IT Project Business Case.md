#### Best Practices
- Aim to quantify all aspects of benefits, costs, and risks
- Ensure all benefits, costs, and risks are included
- Put the different benefits and costs on a timeline, distinguishing when they will be incurred
- If there are large risks or uncertainties, use ranges for the figures and perform a sensitivity analysis with best-case, worst-case and expected scenarios
