#### Best Practices
- Aim to quantify all aspects of benefits, costs, and risks
- Ensure all benefits, costs, and risks are included
- Put the different benefits and costs on a timeline, distinguishing when they will be incurred
- If there are large risks or uncertainties, use ranges for the figures and perform a sensitivity analysis with best-case, worst-case and expected scenarios

#### Success Rate of IT Projects
| Failed $53\%$ | Partially Successful $31\%$ | Successful $16\%$ |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
- Cost overrun on average $89\%$
- Time overrun on average $122\%$

##### Reasons for project failure
| Reason                          |  % age |
| ------------------------------- | -----: |
| Incomplete requirements         | $13\%$ |
| Insufficient user involvement   | $12\%$ |
| Inadequate resources            | $11\%$ |
| Unrealistic user expectations   | $10\%$ |
| Insufficient management support |  $9\%$ |
| Requirement changes             |  $9\%$ |
| Insufficient planning           |  $8\%$ |
Most reasons are at the interface of business and IT

### Components of a Business Case
- **Benefit**
	- All benefits obtained when using the product resulting from the project or investment
	- Quantified and separated for every year in which it is planned to be used
	- Note that "cost reductions" are benefits
- **Cost**
	- **Project costs in business**: All costs incurred in the business for the project, e.g., project management, business analysis, user acceptance testing, training
