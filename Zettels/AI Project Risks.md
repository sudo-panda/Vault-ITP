- Quality of the output may be insufficient for the business purpose
	- Available data may not capture factors strongly influencing the output
	- Insufficient data, or quality of data not high enough
	- Chosen model may not be powerful enough
- Many iterations of data collection, model definition and ML may be needed to get results
- Projects leveraging existing models have much lower risks
